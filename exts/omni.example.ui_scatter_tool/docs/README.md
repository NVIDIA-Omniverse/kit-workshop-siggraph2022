## Overview

This Extension creates a new UI and function to `Scatter` a selected primitive along the X, Y, and Z Axis. The user can set parameters for Objecct Count, Distance, and Randomization. 

## Usage

Once the extension is enabled in the `Extension Manager` the `Scatter Window` will appear. You may dock this window or keep it floating in the console. Select your primitive in the hierarchy that you want to scatter and then click the `S` button next to the `Source > Prim` pathway to set the selected primitive. Then, set your `Scatter Properties` and click the `Scatter` button.
